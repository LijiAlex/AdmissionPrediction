# AdmissionPrediction

Perdict the chances for admission based on input parameters.

## Assumptions
* Missing values filled using median
* Even though data is highly collinear, since VIF is ,10, no need to drop any columns
* Since linear regression, lasso, ridge nd elastic net are gving almost same efficiency, model is generic.

### ML Algorithm 
Linear Regression regularized using ElasticNet
### Standardization
Standard Scaler
